# Write a program that counts lines and characters in a file (similar to `wc` Unix-utility, for additional info
# about it follow the link: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/wc-command-linux-examples/ or in case you have macOS or
# Linux - just call manual for this utility via command: `man wc`).
# Create a Python module called `mymod.py`, which has three functions:
# count_lines(name) function that reads an input file and counts the number of lines in it (hint: file.readlines() does
# most of the work for you, and `len` does the rest)
# count_chars(name) function that reads an input file and counts the number of characters in it (hint: file.read()
# returns a single string)
# test(name) function that calls both counting functions with a given input file­name. Such a filename generally might
# be passed-in, hard-coded, input with raw_input, or pulled from a command-line via the sys.argv list; for now, assume
# it’s a passed-in function argument.
# All three `mymod.py` functions should expect a filename string to be passed in.
# Test your module interactively, using import and name qualification to fetch your exports.
# Does your PYTHONPATH need to include the directory where you created mymod.py?
# Try running your module on itself: e.g., test("mymod.py"). Note that the test opens the file twice; if you’re feeling
# ambitious, you may be able to improve this by passing an open file object into the two count functions
# (hint: file.seek(0) is a file rewind).
from Mymod import count_lines, count_chars, test

print(count_lines("Mike Inez.txt"))
print(count_chars("Mike Inez.txt"))
print(test("Mike Inez.txt"))
